Genetics Institute Inc. , Cambridge , Mass. , said it was awarded U.S. patents for Interleukin-3 and bone morphogenetic protein .

The patent for Interleukin-3 covers materials and methods used to make the human blood cell growth factor via recombinant DNA technology .

Sandoz Ltd. has licensed certain manufacturing and marketing rights for Interleukin-3 from Genetics Institute and is conducting preclinical studies with it .

Interleukin-3 may help in treating blood cell deficiencies associated with cancer treatment , bone marrow transplants and other blood-cell disorders , Genetics Institute said .

The second patent describes bone morphogenetic protein-1 , a substance that can induce formation of new cartilage .

The patent covers BMP-1 type proteins and pharmaceutical compositions and methods for treating bone or cartilage defects , Genetics Institute said .

The company added that it has filed patent applications `` on a large number of different BMP proteins '' and the patent on BMP-1 is the first it has received .

BMP products may be useful in fracture healing and in treating bone loss associated with periodontal disease and certain cancers , the company said .

The Bush administration 's nomination of Clarence Thomas to a seat on the federal appeals court here received a blow this week when the American Bar Association gave Mr. Thomas only a `` qualified '' rating , rather than `` well qualified . ''

People familiar with the Senate Judiciary Committee , which will vote on the nomination , said some liberal members of the panel are likely to question the ABA rating in hearings on the matter .

Mr. Thomas , currently chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , would add another conservative voice to the closely divided court .

Groups have accused him of advocating policies that narrowed rights of older workers and of ignoring discrimination by large companies .

Fourteen members of the House with jurisdiction over the EEOC have said they oppose Mr. Thomas 's nomination because of `` serious questions about his judgment -LCB- and -RCB- respect for the law . ''

A senior Justice Department official , however , said the administration is n't worried about the ABA rating .

`` We 're pleased the ABA rated him qualified , '' David Runkel , the department 's chief spokesman , said in an interview .

The ABA gives a `` qualified '' rating to nominees it believes would perform `` satisfactorily '' on the bench .

In contrast , the lawyers ' association gives a `` well qualified '' rating to those `` regarded as one of the best available for the vacancy .

Metallgesellschaft AG said it agreed to acquire 51 % of Lentjes AG from the Ferdinand Lentjes Foundation .

Terms were n't disclosed .

Metallgesellschaft , a diversified Frankfurt , West Germany-based metals group , said it is buying the stake in the specialized engineering company to expand its production of environmental supplies for power plants .

Lentjes ' product mix of specialized boilers and pipes provides a good fit with its own Lurgi G.m.b . H. plant engineering unit , the company said .

The move is part of a strategy to focus on its core metals trading , processing and plant engineering activities while shedding peripheral units , the company said .

Lentjes had 1988 sales of 800 million marks $ 434.4 million and has a current order backlog of 2.5 billion marks .

The sale comes in place of a planned initial public offering of Lentjes stock .

A plan to bring the stock to market before year end apparently was upset by the recent weakness of Frankfurt share prices .

The U.S. International Trade Commission issued preliminary rulings under the U.S. anti-dumping act that imports of sweaters from Hong Kong , Taiwan and South Korea may be injuring a domestic industry .

Because of the rulings , the Commerce Department will continue to investigate complaints by U.S. sweater makers that the imports are reaching the U.S. at unfairly low prices in violation of the U.S. anti-dumping act .

The law defines unfairly low prices as ones below the cost of production or below prices in an exporter 's home market .

ITC officials said final Commerce Department and ITC rulings wo n't come until next March or later .

If both agencies find violations of the U.S. trade law , the U.S. would assess penalty duties on the imports , which already are subject to import quotas under bilateral textile and apparel trade agreements .

Imports of manmade-fiber sweaters in 1988 totaled about $ 405 million from Taiwan , $ 400 million from South Korea and $ 125 million from Hong Kong , according to the ITC .

In another action , the ITC dismissed anti-dumping act complaints filed by Du Pont Co. of Wilmington , Del. , against imports of neoprene , a type of synthetic rubber , from France and West Germany .

These imports totaled about $ 17 million last year .

Upjohn Co. said it will offer an early retirement package to as many as 1,100 employees in a cost-cutting move expected to result in a fourth-quarter charge .

Upjohn officials said they could n't estimate the size of the charge until they determine which employees , and how many , will participate in the retirement plan .

But the pharmaceutical company said it `` anticipates the long-term savings resulting from the plan 's implementation will more than offset short-term costs . ''

The program , available to Upjohn employees 55 years old or older , could increase an individual 's retirement benefits 10 % to 20 % .

In addition , Upjohn is offering a one-time retirement bonus equal to six months of base pay .

Chairman Theodore Cooper called the program part of the company 's two-year strategy to implement budget constraints and `` an effective headcount-control program . ''

But some analysts questioned how much of an impact the retirement package will have , because few jobs will end up being eliminated .

`` It 's a cosmetic move , '' said Jonathan S. Gelles of Wertheim Schroder & Co .

According to Upjohn 's estimates , only 50 % to 60 % of the 1,100 eligible employees will take advantage of the plan .

Upjohn further estimated that about 50 % of the employees who leave for early retirement may be replaced .

As a result , Upjohn will likely trim only about 275 to 350 of its more than 21,000 jobs world-wide .

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday , Upjohn shares rose 87.5 cents to $ 38.875 apiece .

An Upjohn spokesman said he had `` heard nothing '' to suggest the early retirement package was spurred by shareholder pressure or a potential bidder for the company , which occasionally has been the target of takeover speculation .

The company earlier this year adopted a shareholder-rights plan to ward off unwanted suitors .

The spokesman said it is the first early retirement plan offered under its two-year cost-control strategy .

Earlier staff-reduction moves have trimmed about 300 jobs , the spokesman said .

INTER-TEL Inc . Chandler , Ariz. --

Jerry Chapman , managing director of WayMar Associates , was elected a director of this business telecommunications software and systems concern .

He increases the board to seven .

`` Feeding Frenzy '' Henry Holt , 326 pages , $ 19.95 , a highly detailed account of the Wedtech scandal , begins on a reassuring note .

Right up front in the preface , co-author William Sternberg gives us an example of his own integrity .

When offered a free trip from the Bronx , Wedtech 's home , to Washington , D.C. , by one of Wedtech 's principals , he tells the reader , `` mindful of accepting anything of value from those I was writing about , I declined . ''

Any question as to why an author would believe this plaintive , high-minded note of assurance is necessary is answered by reading this book about sticky fingers and sweaty scammers .

Bribe by bribe , Mr. Sternberg and his co-author , Matthew C. Harrison Jr. , lead us along the path Wedtech traveled , from its inception as a small manufacturing company to the status of full-fledged defense contractor , entrusted with the task of producing vital equipment for the Army and Navy .

The book revolves around John Mariotta , the founder of the company , and Fred Neuberger , who became his partner soon after Wedtech 's creation .

Although started in 1965 , Wedtech did n't really get rolling until 1975 , when Mr. Neuberger discovered the federal government 's Section 8 A minority business program .

This is a Johnson-era , Great Society creation that mandates certain government contracts be awarded noncompetitively to minority businesses .

Mr. Neuberger realized that , although of Italian ancestry , Mr. Mariotta still could qualify as a minority person since he was born in Puerto Rico .

The two partners merely had to falsify the true ownership of the corporation .

Instead of 50/50 it became , on paper only , two-thirds Mariotta , one-third Neuberger , and they were in the program and off to the races .

Besides being a `` minority-owned company '' Wedtech was located in the South Bronx , a blighted area , made famous by Jimmy Carter in his 1976 presidential campaign .

The company plugged itself right into Carter campaign rhetoric about rebuilding the South Bronx and kept using the minority -- South Bronx angle through the Reagan '80s .

Starting with Congressman Mario Biaggi now serving a jail sentence , the company began a career of bribing federal , state and local public officials and those close to public officials , right up to and including E. Robert Wallach , close friend and adviser to former Attorney General Ed Meese .

Wedtech did n't just use old fashioned bribery .

It made ample use of the modern techniques of influence peddling , retaining politically connected `` respectable '' law firms , investment bankers and political consultants , including Reagan confidant Lyn Nofzinger .

When necessary , it sought and received assistance from organized crime .

Sometimes the bribed became partners in the company .

Wedtech management used the merit system .

If you were especially helpful in a corrupt scheme you received not just cash in a bag , but equity .

If you were not an effective crook , you found yourself out in the cold , a fate that eventually befell Mr. Mariotta , the firm 's semiliterate `` minority '' person .

But despite the sensational nature of the revelations and the breezy , easy-to-read tabloid writing style , `` Feeding Frenzy '' often falls short of gripping reading .

None of the scams show much ingenuity : Auditors found crookery the first day on the job .

Wedtech 's scammers simply bribed them to shut up .

The scammers themselves were garden-variety low lifes , conspicuous consumers who wanted big houses , Mercedes cars , beautiful women , expensive clothes .

Among the lot of them , not one is wrestling with good and evil , or especially intelligent or even temporarily insane .

The one character at least somewhat interesting was Irving Louis Lobsenz , a pediatrician who changed his name to Rusty Kent London and became a master gambler and author of a book on blackjack .

He enters the story toward the end , just in time to get arrested .

Absorbed in doling out `` Feeding Frenzy 's '' tidbits , the authors gloss over the root causes of Wedtech , namely the Section 8 A federal program under whose auspices the scandal took place .

They do at least come around to saying that the courts might want to end `` rigid affirmative action programs . ''

Programs like Section 8 A are a little like leaving gold in the street and then expressing surprise when thieves walk by to scoop it up .

Numerous other scandals , among them the ones at HUD , have the same characteristics as Wedtech .

They take place in government programs that seem tailor-made for corruption .

Why are programs like this not eliminated ?

`` Feeding Frenzy '' does provide a few clues .

In and around all levels of government in the U.S. are groups of people who can best be described as belonging to a political insider commercial party .

They know that whenever government is redistributing wealth , regulating commerce or maintaining a large defense establishment , there is big money to be made in influencing , brokering or selling the processes and decisions of government .

They are our version of the East bloc 's Nomenklatura and they have absolutely no wish to see anything change .

How many government programs and policies exist because they line the pockets of political insiders ?

This is the real issue raised by the Wedtech scandal .

Mr. Stern was chairman and chief executive officer of the New York State Urban Development Corp. , 1983-85 .

The Finnish government and major creditors of bankrupt shipyard Waertsilae Marine Industries Oy agreed in principle to form a new company to complete most of the troubled shipyard 's backlog of 15 ships .

The new company will attempt to limit the shipyard 's losses , participants said .

`` The situation is that the bankruptcy court will get out of the shipbuilding business .

Everything will be taken over by the new company , '' said Christian Andersson , executive vice president of Oy Waertsilae , former parent of Waertsilae Marine .

Once its ownership is finalized , the new company will open talks with state-appointed receivers to buy or lease Waertsilae Marine 's shipyard facilities .

Subcontractors will be offered a settlement and a swift transition to new management is expected to avert an exodus of skilled workers from Waertsilae Marine 's two big shipyards , government officials said .

Under an accord signed yesterday , the government and Union Bank of Finland would become major shareholders in the new company , each injecting 100 million Finnish markkaa $ 23.5 million .

Oy Waertsilae is to contribute 200 million markkaa , most of it as subordinated debt , and take a minority stake in the new company .

Customers holding contracts for Waertsilae Marine 's undelivered ships are expected to subscribe most of the remaining 170 million markkaa in share capital , government officials said .

Waertsilae Marine 's biggest creditor is Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines Inc .

Carnival , which has three ships on order from Waertsilae Marine , presented claims for $ 1.5 billion damages in the bankruptcy court this week .

Waertsilae Marine 's bankruptcy proceedings began Tuesday in a Helsinki court .

Its plans to be acquired dashed , Comprehensive Care Corp. said it plans to sell most of its psychiatric and drug abuse facilities in California and some other assets to pay its debt and provide working capital .

In all , the company hopes to repay $ 45 million in debt through the sales , which will completely discharge its secured debt , the company said .

In addition , the company has replaced its president and chief executive , naming W. James Nichol , head of the company 's contract health services , to succeed B. Lee Karns .

Mr. Nichol said he was `` extremely disappointed in the continuing deterioration of the company 's operations while it attempted to conclude the reorganization during the past four months . ''

Concurrent with Mr. Nichol 's appointment , Comprehensive Care moved its corporate headquarters from Irvine , Calif. , to St. Louis , where the company maintained its contract services offices .

Mr. Karns continues as chairman .

Comprehensive Care had agreed to be acquired by closely held First Hospital Corp. of Norfolk , Va. , but the sale sputtered almost from the beginning and finally collapsed last week .

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday , Comprehensive Care closed at $ 3.75 a share , up 12.5 cents .

Ralston Purina Co. reported a 47 % decline in fourth-quarter earnings , reflecting restructuring costs as well as a more difficult pet food market .

The St. Louis company earned $ 45.2 million , or 65 cents a share , compared with $ 84.9 million , or $ 1.24 a share , a year earlier .

Sales in the latest period were $ 1.76 billion , a 13 % increase from last year 's $ 1.55 billion .

For the year ended Sept. 30 , Ralston earned $ 422.5 million , or $ 6.44 a share , up 8.9 % from $ 387.8 million , or $ 5.63 a share .

This year 's results included a gain of $ 70.2 million on the disposal of seafood operations .

Sales for the full year were $ 6.6 billion , up 13 % from $ 5.8 billion .

Ralston said its restructuring costs include the phase-out of a battery facility in Greenville , N.C. , the recent closing of a Hostess cake bakery in Cincinnati and a reduction in staff throughout the company .

The battery plant , which makes rechargeable nickel cadmium and carbon zinc products , will be closed over the next year or so , a spokesman said .

Ralston attributed its fourth-quarter slump partly to higher costs of ingredients in the pet food business as well as competitive pressures , which required higher advertising spending .

For the year , pet food volume was flat , the company said .

Its cereal division realized higher operating profit on volume increases , but also spent more on promotion .

The Continental Baking business benefited from higher margins on bread and on increased cake sales , it added .

Ralston said its Eveready battery unit was hurt by continuing economic problems in South America .

Ralston shares closed yesterday at $ 80.5, off $ 1 , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .

Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted .

The percent difference compares actual profit with the 30-day estimate where at least three analysts have issues forecasts in the past 30 days .

Otherwise , actual profit is compared with the 300-day estimate .

First Chicago Corp. said it completed its $ 55.1 million cash-and-stock acquisition of closely held Ravenswood Financial Corp. , another Chicago bank holding company .

The record corn-buying binge by the Soviet Union is causing serious bottlenecks in the U.S. grain pipeline .

The Soviet purchases are so massive that exporters are struggling to find enough river barges and trains to move the recently harvested Midwest crop to ports for loading onto Soviet ships .

River barge rates have soared 40 % this fall from a year earlier .

Railroad companies and some ports are reaping a sudden windfall of business .

And some grain analysts are predicting that corn prices might gyrate this month as exporters scrounge to find enough of the crop to meet their obligations to the Soviets .

The Soviet Union bought roughly 310 million bushels of U.S. corn in October , which is the most ever sold to the Soviet Union in one month from the U.S. .

The Soviet Union wants much of it delivered by January , which would be a strain in most years .

But it is particularly difficult this autumn because of low water levels on the Mississippi River , on which flows much of the U.S. corn that is shipped overseas .

`` We are shipping the most corn in that short of time period to one customer on record , '' said William Dunton , a U.S. Agriculture Department transportation expert .

`` It is going to be real tight . ''

Because of persistent dry weather in the northern Plains , the water level on the upper section of the Mississippi River is so low that many river operators are already trimming the number of barges their tows push at one time .

In a few weeks , many barges probably wo n't be able to operate fully loaded south of St. Louis because the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is beginning to reduce the flow of the Missouri River , which feeds into the Mississippi River .

The Army Corps is cutting the flow of the Missouri River about two weeks earlier than normal because of low water levels in the reservoirs that feed it .

Barge rates on the Mississippi River sank yesterday on speculation that widespread rain this week in the Midwest might temporarily alleviate the situation .

But the Army Corps of Engineers expects the river level to continue falling this month .

At St. Louis , the water level of the Mississippi River is already 6.5 feet below normal and it could drop an additional 2.5 feet when the flow of the Missouri River is slowed , an Army Corps spokesman said .

Similar levels hamstrung barge shipments last year in the wake of the worst drought in 50 years .

So far , the grain industry 's budding logistical problems have n't been a major factor in the trading of corn contracts at the Chicago Board of Trade .

Many grain processors and exporters use the price of the corn futures contracts traded there to calculate the price they offer to buy corn from farmers .

At the Board of Trade yesterday the price of the corn contract for December delivery slipped 3.5 cents a bushel to settle at $ 2.375 a bushel .

Corn prices have been sluggish this fall despite the huge Soviet orders because the harvest has allowed farmers to rebuild the stockpiles depleted by the 1988 drought .

With the harvest winding down , however , some analysts are speculating that prices might jump in some regions as U.S. exporters try to gather the corn they are obligated to deliver .

Farmers are in the best position of many years to push up corn prices .

Because the drought reduced U.S. stockpiles , they have more than enough storage space for their new crop , and that permits them to wait for prices to rise .

In parts of Iowa , for example , some grain elevators are offering farmers $ 2.15 a bushel for corn .

Many farmers probably would n't sell until prices rose at least 20 cents a bushel , said Lyle Reed , president of Chicago Central & Pacific Railroad Co. of Waterloo , Iowa .

It is n't clear , however , who would win a waiting game .

Although U.S. corn stockpiles shrank by roughly half in the wake of the drought , the Agriculture Department projects that nearly one-fifth of the harvest will still be in storage before the 1990 corn harvest begins .

Some analysts are worried that reports of the grain industry 's problems might spark investors to begin buying corn futures contracts -- only to see little appreciation .

`` The public is buying the market when in reality there is plenty of grain to be shipped , '' said Bill Biedermann , Allendale Inc. research director .

Although much of this country 's export corn goes to New Orleans by barge , it is possible for exporters to sidestep the Mississippi River by shipping a larger-than-normal amount of corn by train to the port .

Ports in the Great Lakes and Atlantic Coast can also relieve pressure on New Orleans .

One railroad , for example , is already increasing its grain hauling service from Indiana to Baltimore .

And it is n't clear that the Soviet Union will stay on its record buying pace .

The Soviet orders were compressed into the month of October because of delays .

The Soviet Union usually begins buying U.S. crops earlier in the fall .

But its purchases apparently were delayed by a reorganization of its agricultural bureaucracy as well as budget problems .

In other commodity markets yesterday :

ENERGY : Crude oil futures prices increased in moderate trading , but much of the action was in heating oil .

Prices rose on the news that a sizable West German refinery was damaged in a fire , tightening an already tight European market .

Heating oil for November delivery ended at 58.64 cents a gallon , up one cent on the New York Mercantile Exchange .

West Texas Intermediate for December delivery advanced 22 cents to $ 19.94 a barrel .

Gasoline futures continued a sell-off that began Monday .

PRECIOUS METALS : Futures prices eased as increased stability and strength came into the securities markets .

December delivery gold fell $ 3.2an ounce to $ 377.6.

December silver declined 6.50 cents an ounce to $ 5.218.

January platinum was down $ 5.7an ounce at $ 494.5.

Precious metals , gold in particular , currently are being influenced more by stock market gyrations than the dollar as traders seek greater investment stability , according to William O'Neill , vice president of research at Elders Futures in New York .

`` The recent rally in precious metals was a result of uncertainty and volatility in equities , '' he said .

Yesterday , the stock market rose strongly , creating a more defensive attitude among precious metals traders , he said .

Silver and platinum , which have more of an industrial nature than gold , were even weaker , he said .

Silver is also under pressure of `` extremely high '' inventories in warehouses of the Commodity Exchange , he said .

Yesterday , these stocks rose by 170,262 ounces to a record of 226,570,380 ounces , according to an exchange spokesman .

COPPER : Futures prices partially recovered Monday 's declines because Chilean miners voted to strike .

The December contract rose 1.20 cents a pound to $ 1.14 .

In Chile , workers at two copper mines , Los Bronces and El Soldado , which belong to the Exxon-owned Minera Disputada , yesterday voted to begin a full strike tomorrow , an analyst said .

Reasons for the walkout , the analyst said , included a number of procedural issues , such as a right to strike .

The analyst noted that also inherent in all metal markets was a sympathetic reaction to stocks .

In the case of copper , he said , the upbeat mood of stocks was reflected in demand for futures contracts because a stronger economy means greater buying interest for the metal .

Also contributing to the firmness in copper , the analyst noted , was a report by Chicago purchasing agents , which precedes the full purchasing agents ' report that is due out today and gives an indication of what the full report might hold .

The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago 's October index rose to 51.6 % after three previous months of readings below 50 % .

The September index was 47.1 % .

A reading below 50 % generally indicates a slowing in the industrial sector of the economy , while a reading above 50 % points to expansion .

The Chicago report raised the possibility that the October survey of the National Association of Purchasing Management would also show a reading above 50 % .

NCR Corp. unveiled two models of its Tower line of midrange computers and introduced advanced networking software to allow the Tower family to operate as a central hub in a network of computers .

The new software is based on Novell Inc. 's NetWare network operating system software .

USX Corp. posted a 23 % drop in third-quarter profit , as improved oil results failed to offset weakness in steel and natural gas operations .

The nation 's largest steelmaker earned $ 175 million , or 62 cents a share , compared with the year-earlier $ 228 million , or 80 cents a share .

The recent quarter includes pretax gains of $ 98 million from asset sales , while like gains in the year-earlier quarter totaled $ 61 million .

In the 1988 period , USX also had a $ 71 million after-tax gain from a tax dispute settlement .

Sales rose 5 % to $ 4.4 billion from $ 4.2 billion .

The earnings drop appears particularly steep in comparison with last year 's unusually strong third quarter , when the company was riding an industrywide boom in demand and pricing .

However , third-quarter operating profit fell 14 % , as USX sold sizable chunks of its diversified and steel segments , eliminating income from those operations .

Among segments that continue to operate , though , the company 's steel division continued to suffer from soft demand for its tubular goods serving the oil industry and other markets .

Peter Marcus , an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. , said that a downturn in the appliance industry , coupled with sluggish automotive sales , hurt USX results .

Moreover , USX exports more than other steelmakers , and the overseas market has been under more severe pricing pressure .

The company attributed lower sales and earnings for the steel segment to the loss of results from the Lorain , Ohio , plant , which now is a 50-50 joint venture with Japan 's Kobe Steel Ltd .

In the steel division , operating profit dropped 11 % to $ 85 million .

Profit per ton of steel shipped dropped to about $ 33 a ton from $ 42 a ton last year and $ 53 a ton in the second quarter , analysts said .

Still , USX fared better than other major steelmakers , earning more per ton of steel shipped than either Bethlehem Steel Corp. , which posted a 54 % drop in net income , or Inland Steel Industries Inc. , whose profit plummeted 70 % .

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , USX shares closed up $ 1.25 , at $ 34.625 , as the reported earnings exceeded projections by some analysts who had n't expected as great a volume of asset sales .

The rise in the stock 's price may also reflect the fact that USX 's steel segment fared better than some other steelmakers ' .

Charles Bradford , an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets , said USX may have received orders lost by competitors who were involved in labor contracts earlier this year .

He said USX also appeared to sell a richer mix of steel products , such as the more profitable pipe and galvanized coated sheet , than lower-priced structural goods .

The energy segment , with a 15 % rise in operating profit , is clearly the company 's strongest .

Higher crude oil prices helped boost operating profit for the Marathon Oil Co. unit to $ 198 million from $ 180 million .

The Texas Oil & Gas division continues to operate in the red , although losses narrowed to $ 9 million from $ 15 million .

USX announced in October that it was soliciting bids to sell TXO 's oil and gas reserves .

Proceeds of that sale are to be used to reduce debt and buy back shares .

The company noted that it has reduced debt by $ 1.6 billion since the end of 1988 and bought back about 15.5 million shares of common stock since the fourth quarter of 1987 .

USX has about $ 5.5 billion in long-term debt and 257 million shares outstanding .

The announced sale of the reserves was followed by news that investor Carl Icahn had increased his stake in USX to 13.1 % and threatened a takeover or other business combination .

Mr. Icahn has said he believes USX would be worth more if broken up into steel and energy segments .

Profit for the nine months jumped 21 % to $ 721 million , or $ 2.62 a share , from $ 598 million , or $ 2.07 a share .

Sales rose 10 % to $ 13.8 billion from $ 12.5 billion .

John F. Barrett , 40 , formerly executive vice president and chief financial officer , was named president and chief operating officer , posts which had been vacant .

Leon J. Level , vice president and chief financial officer of this computer services concern , and F. Warren McFarlan , a professor at Harvard University 's Graduate School of Business , were elected directors , increasing board membership to nine .

David A. DiLoreto , president of metal container division , was named to the additional post of group vice president , packaging products , at this packaging , industrial and aerospace products concern , succeeding Delmont A. Davis , who was named president and chief operating officer in August .

Two leading constitutional-law experts said President Bush does n't have the legal authority to exercise a line-item veto .

Professors Philip Kurland of the University of Chicago and Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School said any effort by President Bush to claim authority for a line-item veto would contradict the text of the Constitution and the intent of its authors , as well as the views of previous presidents .

A line-item veto is a procedure that would allow a president to veto part of a big congressional spending bill without having to scuttle the entire measure .

Mr. Bush has said he would like to be able to use this procedure .

A White House spokesman said last week that the president is considering declaring that the Constitution implicitly gives him the authority for a line-item veto to provoke a test case .

But the two legal experts , responding to an inquiry by Sen. Edward Kennedy D. , Mass. , wrote in a joint letter that the president `` lacks the constitutional authority to exercise a line-item veto . ''

The two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum -- Mr. Kurland is a conservative and Mr. Tribe is a liberal .

The two professors said the Constitution authorizes the president to veto entire bills , not partial measures .

Moreover , they said the first appropriations bill passed 200 years ago covered many different items , and there was no discussion of a line-item veto .

They also said that more than a dozen presidents have called for line-item veto authority since the Civil War , and `` all have shared the view that such lawmaking power is beyond the reach '' of the president .

Sen. Kennedy said in a separate statement that he supports legislation to give the president line-item veto power , but that it would be a `` reckless course of action '' for President Bush to claim the authority without congressional approval .

Trinity Industries Inc. said it reached a preliminary agreement to sell 500 railcar platforms to Trailer Train Co. of Chicago .

Terms were n't disclosed .

Trinity said it plans to begin delivery in the first quarter of next year .
